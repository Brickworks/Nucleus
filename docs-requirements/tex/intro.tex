\section{Introduction}

TerraMICRO is a high altitude balloon (HAB) technology demonstration mission.
The key objectives of this mission are to validate a new HAB avionics 
architecture called \textmu HAB, experiment with core technologies which enable 
long duration flights, and collect high quality images from high altitudes.

As a technology demonstrator, TerraMICRO flight systems are intended
to be used on future HAB systems. TerraMICRO systems are designed to be
generic in order to support any future mission. TerraHAB has selected long
duration flights as a target for future missions, and as such many of the 
systems beyond the core avionics are building blocks toward this goal.
    
This document shall list and describe all mission requirements and their 
criteria for success, all system requirements and their criteria for 
performance, and (when applicable) methods by which the aforementioned 
requiremnts shall be evaluated. The intent of this specification is to quantify and control the criteria
by which mission success is defined, and to provide traceability to each
subsystem's performance to ensure mission success is achieved by the 
vehicle's design.
