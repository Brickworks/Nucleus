%% Mission and System Requirements Specification
%%
%% This document shall list and describe all system requirements, their
%% criteria for performance, and (when applicable) methods by which these 
%% requiremnts shall be evaluated.
%%
%% The intent of this specification is to quantify and control the criteria
%% by which mission success is defined, and to provide traceability to each
%% subsystem's performance to ensure mission success is achieved by the 
%% vehicle's design.
%%
%% Created November 26, 2018 by Phil Linden
%% *************************************************************************
All of the systems demonstrated by this mission shall be thoroughly tested
on the ground prior to launch. Flight data and telemetry recorded during the
flight should be consistent with behavior observed during testing.
