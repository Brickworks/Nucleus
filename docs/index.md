# Nucleus

This is the documentation homepage for Nucleus, Mission 1 of the Brickworks
Project.

The documentation here logs our ideas, designs, and decisions through the
design process from concept selection to post-flight analysis.

## What is Brickworks?

Brickworks is a group of engineers who are passionate about aerospace. The
group formed in November 2018 as an outlet for alumni members of the
student-faculty research group RIT Space Exploration (SPEX) to continue
doing space-related engineering projects.

Brickworks's mission is to do novel things with accesible hardware, share
the knowledge gained along the way, and set an example of excellence for
similar hobby projects.

## Why a High Altitude Balloon?

High Altitude Balloons (HABs) are low-cost, low-risk vehicles that are
the perfect platform for conducting small scale atmospheric studies,
remote sensing, and other experiments that make use of the "edge of
space" conditions found at altitudes in excess of 65,000 feet above sea
level. Atmospheric conditions in the stratosphere are fairly well
understood insofar as the humidity, temperatures, and pressures that
must be weathered by a flight platform. More specifically, ambient
temperatures and pressures between 65,000--100,000, feet altitude see
extremes of -60C and 0.05 atm respectively.

HABs are an excellent platform to experiment with and learn aerospace
engineering skills and techniques as a hobbyist without the prohibitively
high capital requirements of building a spacecraft. This means engineers
can also experiment with more novel ideas or gain experience on a
risk-tolerant and short-turnaround project.

## What is Nucleus?

Nucleus is a high altitude balloon technology demonstration mission.
The key objectives of this mission are to develop a robust avionics
architecture, experiment with core technologies which enable long
duration flights, broadcast telemetry to a remote ground terminal,
and optionally collect high quality images from high altitudes.
As a technology demonstrator, Nucleus flight systems are designed 
with the intent to be improved or expanded upon in future missions.
