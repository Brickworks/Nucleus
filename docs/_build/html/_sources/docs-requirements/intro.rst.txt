\section{Introduction}

High Altitude Balloons (HABs) are a low-cost, relatively low-risk vehicles that
are a perfect platform for conducting small scale atmospheric studies, remote
sensing, and other experiments that make use of the ``edge of space'' conditions
found at altitudes in excess of 65,000 feet above sea level. Atmospheric
conditions in the stratosphere are fairly well understood insofar as the
humidity, temperatures, and pressures that must be weathered by a flight
platform. More specifically, ambient temperatures and pressures between
65,000--100,000\,feet altitude see extremes of -60\textdegree\,C and $0.05$\,atm
respectively.

This opens the door to opportunities for generic or payload-agnostic HAB
platforms designed to carry an experiment or instruments in conditions that
approximate space. One such platform is an avionics architecture called \textmu
HAB, which is designed specifically to be a robust and all-inclusive avionics
package for HAB vehicles. The
\href{https://esto.nasa.gov/technologists_trl.html}{Technology Readiness Level}
of \textmu HAB is TRL 2. 

TerraMICRO is a high altitude balloon technology demonstration mission. The key
objectives of this mission are to validate the new \textmu HAB avionics
architecture, experiment with core technologies which enable long duration
flights, and collect high quality images from high altitudes. As a technology
demonstrator, TerraMICRO flight systems are intended to be used on future HAB
systems. TerraMICRO systems are designed to be generic in order to support any
future mission. TerraHAB has selected long duration flights as a target for
future missions, and as such many of the systems beyond the core avionics are
building blocks toward this goal. At the time of launch, \textmu HAB should be
TRL 3, and upon the successful completion of the TerraMICRO mission this
architecture will be TRL 5.

This section shall list and describe all mission requirements and their
criteria for success, all system requirements and their criteria for
performance, and (when applicable) methods by which the aforementioned
requiremnts shall be evaluated. The intent of this specification is to quantify
and control the criteria by which mission success is defined, and to provide
traceability to each subsystem's performance to ensure mission success is
achieved by the vehicle's design.
