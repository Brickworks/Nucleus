%%
%% The intent of this specification is to quantify and control the criteria 
%% by which mission success is defined, and to provide traceability to each
%% subsystem's performance to ensure mission success is achieved by the

\section{Mission Requirements}
\subsection{Critical Design Requirements}
Regardless of the mission objectives, the HAB system must meet several key
design requirements in order to achieve mission success. These requirements
serve as success criteria and also as constraints to the design trade space.
These criteria stem from
\href{https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?rgn=div5&node=14:2.0.1.3.15#sp14.2.101.d}{federal
regulations} for unmanned free balloons and other basic functions to ensure
a safe, controlled flight.

\begin{table}[ht]
    \centering
    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{X}
        The flight vehicle \underline{must} include multiple independent
        cut-down mechanisms.                                       \\
        The flight vehicle \underline{must} have at least one redundant system
        capable of transmitting its coordinates to ground control. \\
        The flight vehicle \underline{must} remain powered-on and airborne for
        at least 3 hours.                                          \\
        The flight vehicle \underline{must} have a total mass of no more than
        2.72\,kg (6\,lbs).                                         \\
    \end{tabularx}
    \label{mission-reqs:key-requirements}
\end{table}

The objectives listed in \autoref{mission-reqs:eng-objectives} provide the basis
for TerraHAB's criteria for success and drive all other mission requirements.
These objectives steer the vision and end goals for the mission and every
subsystem or feature in the end result should support at least one of these
objectives.

\begin{table}[ht]
    \centering
    \caption{Engineering \& Technology Objectives}
    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
        \toprule
        \textit{In-Flight Balloon Monitoring}   & A system will be able to
        monitor the  temperature and pressure within a balloon and report that
        back to the HAB payload.
        \\

        \textit{\textmu HAB Avionics Platform}  & Flight test \textmu HAB as a
        flexible, expandable, and cost-effective platform to support many
        different mission profiles or payloads with all of the basics for a HAB
        launch included out of the box.                                        \\ %\cite{dans microhab design doc}

        \textit{Open-Loop Altitude Regulation}  & Limit maximum altitude and
        rate of ascent by the controlled release of helium during flight to
        prolong the mission duration. Maintain 75,000 feet altitude for at least
        30 minutes.                                                            \\

        \textit{HD On-Board Video}              & Horizon-looking full color
        video at 1080p\@30 fps or better (1080p\@60fps or 4K\@30fps preferred).
        \\

        \textit{Video Capture of Balloon Burst} & Capture the balloon burst
        event with minimum resolution of 720p\@60fps or better. (720p@120fps or
        1080p@120fps preferred)                                                \\

There are several design features that are specific requests from TerraHAB
engineers. The flight system should meet these requests or provide justification
for not including them. These features are not required for mission success as
defined in \autoref{mission-reqs:eng-objectives}, but it is expected that the
TerraHAB team strives to accomplish these goals. These objectives are listed in
\autoref{mission-reqs:desired-objectives}.

    \caption{Stretch Goals \& Desired Features}
    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
        \toprule
        \textit{``Remove Before Flight'' Pins} & Include externally accessible
        remove before flight pins to safe or disarm subsystems while on the
        ground, such as a power pin (included in \textmu HAB), a startup
        sequence pin, a launch pin, and so on.
        \\
        \textit{Status Inticators \& Displays} & Include displays and self-test
        and status check codes to ensure that the balloon is stable and behaving
        nominally during testing, integration, and preparation for flight.
        \\
        \textit{Simple Balloon Filling}        & Simple and clear procedures
        during flight preparations, including a quick-disconnect from helium
        fill plumbing.                                                          \\
        \textit{Vegetation Density Experiment} & Use NDVI with a commercially
        available RGB (VNIR) camera to estimate vegetation density from images
        in real time during flight. Minimum video quality 480p\@30fps.
        \\
