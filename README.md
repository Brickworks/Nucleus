A high altitude balloon (HAB) and the first mission from 
[Brickworks](https://github.com/Brickworks).

Nucleus is a high altitude balloon technology demonstration mission. The key
objectives of this mission are to develop a robust avionics architecture,
experiment with core technologies which enable long duration flights, broadcast
telemetry to a remote ground terminal, and optionally collect high quality
images from high altitudes. As a technology demonstrator, Nucleus flight
systems are designed with the intent to be improved or expanded upon in future
missions.
